Insert Sort 
usage: insertSort.py [-h] [path]

Use insertSort to sort lines of integers in a file.  Results will be stored in
insert.out.

positional arguments:
  path        The file with lines of integers to sort. Will default to
              data.txt if not provided.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit


insertSort.py assumes many things:
    - The data file is specified on the command line when the program is called.  
        Otherwise it will default to "data.txt".
    - The data file is in the same directory as insertSort.py, otherwise it will 
        print a message to the user and exit.
    - Each line of data the data file contains a string of integers.
    - The first integer on each line is the quantity of remaining integers on that
        line, otherwise it will print a message to the user and exit.
