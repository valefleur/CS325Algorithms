activitySelection.py assumes many things:
    - An empty line signifies the end of data.
    - The first line gives the quantity of activities in the first problem set,
        followed by one line per activity containing the name, start time and 
        finish time of each problem in the set.  The quantity of activities in
        subsequent sets starts on the line directly after the last activity in 
        the previous set.
